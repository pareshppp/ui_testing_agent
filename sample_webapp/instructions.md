Create a sample react webapp with a form with the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Message

And a submit button.

On submit, the form should be saved to a file.

The response should be displayed in a modal popup.

The modal should have the following fields:

- Status Code
- Headers
- JSON Response

And a close button.

The modal should be displayed in the center of the screen.

The modal should be closed when the close button is clicked.

Use FastAPI for the backend.

Keep all frontend and backend files inside the `src/sample_webapp` directory.
